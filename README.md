# Non-Code Hacktoberfest 2023

Welcome to the Non-Code Hacktoberfest 2023 project! We're excited to have you here. While Hacktoberfest is traditionally associated with coding, we believe that contributions go beyond just writing code. This project is all about making a meaningful impact in non-technical ways.

## What is Non-Code Hacktoberfest?

Non-Code Hacktoberfest is an opportunity for people who want to contribute to open source projects but don't code. Here, you can help with documentation, design, community building, and more. We appreciate your efforts in making the open-source community even better.

## How to Contribute

1. **Browse the Issues**: Take a look at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CSI-DMCE-2023/NON-CODE-HacktoberFest-2023/issues) to find tasks you can contribute to. These might include documentation improvements, design suggestions, community engagement ideas, and more.

2. **Claim an Issue**: When you find an issue that interests you, comment on it to let others know you're working on it. If it's available, an admin will assign it to you.

3. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

4. **Make Your Contributions**: Work on the issue you claimed. You can create or edit documents, design visuals, or contribute in other non-technical ways.

5. **Create a Pull Request**: When you're ready to submit your contributions, create a pull request. Make sure to follow our guidelines.

6. **Review and Collaborate**: Collaborate with other contributors and maintainers to refine your contributions. Address any feedback and make necessary changes.
